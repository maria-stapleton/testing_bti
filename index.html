						<p>Annie Malone, born in 1869 to formerly enslaved parents develops a hair and cosmetics brand
							and beauty school that is incredibly successful. Malone recognises three things: appearance
							to African American women is intrinsically related to the discrimination they face; their is
							a gap in the market for hair straightening (to meet American beauty standards) while keeping
							hair and scalp healthy; and third, a demand for inclusive cosmetics. Malone became a
							successful and wealthy businesswoman, providing employment to other African American women
							and a keen philanthropist. The brand however did suffer after a divorce settlement and

							instance Gillette used endorsements of figures in areas deemed ‘very masculine’ in the
							respected markets. Football in Brazil, boxing in the United States. And while actors such as
							Marlon Brando did embody masculinity and influenced men’s body standards to an extent,
							increasing pressures for a muscular body, this was felt more strongly amongst younger men.
