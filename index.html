					  <p2>1820s men’s dress — Fashion Museum Bath</p2>
					  <p>As the 1800s progressed men in the west started steering away from what is now recognised as ‘feminising markers’ and morally illegitimate — this included in dress where colours, pattern and frills; cosmetics stopped being used; and moving into the 1900s fragrance became gendered. This shift impacted other markets, notably Japan which began adopting more gender distinctions through appearance.</p>

					  <p>Annie Malone, born in 1869 to formerly enslaved parents develops a hair and cosmetics brand and beauty school that is incredibly successful. Malone recognises three things: appearance to African American women is intrinsically related to the discrimination they face; their is a gap in the market for hair straightening (to meet American beauty standards) while keeping hair and scalp healthy; and third, a demand for inclusive cosmetics. Malone became a successful  and wealthy businesswoman, providing employment to other African American women and a keen philanthropist. The brand however did suffer after a divorce settlement and because of the Great Depression.</p>
